# Skin-Cancer-Detection


Kaggle hosts several datasets of skin lesion images.

You will find the data sets on the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/isic-2024-challenge/data


### Project Description
In this project, I trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using the provided dataset.


### Project Status
Unfortunately, I did not submit this project to Kaggle for evaluation.


### Future Work
I may continue to work on this code for my own projects when I have the opportunity.



### The images vary in size, and the dataset is extremely unbalanced
